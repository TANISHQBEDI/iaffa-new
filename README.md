- All pages compile without TypeScript errors (types validation skipped in config)
- No runtime errors detected during build

### Notes
- Project uses npm for package management (dependencies installed successfully)
- Uses Next.js App Router architecture
- All pages include Navigation and Footer components
- Images are served from `/public/images/` directory
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme colors (champagne, primary, eerie-black, etc.)

## Architecture Refactor Complete

### Refactoring Summary
The project has been successfully refactored to introduce a `src/` directory structure and modular architecture as required.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Source Directory Structure
- **Created `src/` directory** at project root
- **Moved `app/` to `src/app/`** - Next.js App Router now located in `src/app/`
- **Moved `components/` to `src/components/`** - All shared components
- **Moved `hooks/` to `src/hooks/`** - Custom React hooks
- **Moved `lib/` to `src/lib/`** - Utility functions
- **Updated `tsconfig.json`** - Path aliases now point to `./src/*`

#### 2. Modules Architecture
Created modular structure for each route with the following pattern:
```
src/modules/
  {module-name}/
    ui/
      pages/      # Page components
      sections/   # Section components (empty, ready for future use)
      components/ # Module-specific components (empty, ready for future use)
```

Modules created:
- `home` - Home page module
- `about` - About page module
- `contact` - Contact page module
- `membership` - Membership page module
- `news` - News page module
- `oman-partnership` - Oman Partnership page module
- `prizes` - Prizes page module
- `program` - Program page module
- `submissions` - Submissions page module

#### 3. Routing Isolation
- **Route files (`src/app/*/page.tsx`)** now contain only:
  - Metadata exports (for SEO)
  - Import and re-export of module page components
  - No UI JSX in route files

Example:
```tsx
import HomePage from "@/modules/home/ui/pages/home-page"

export default function Page() {
  return <HomePage />
}
```

#### 4. UI Isolation
- **All page UI logic** moved to `src/modules/{module}/ui/pages/{module}-page.tsx`
- **Exact JSX preserved** - No changes to classNames, structure, or components
- **All imports updated** to use `@/` absolute imports
- **Public image paths unchanged** - All `/images/` references remain valid

#### 5. Build Verification
- ✅ **Build successful** - `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ **All routes compile** - 11 routes (including `/_not-found`) generated successfully
- ✅ **No runtime errors** - All pages render correctly
- ✅ **TypeScript paths working** - All `@/` imports resolve correctly

### Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of concerns** - Routing logic separated from UI logic
- **Modular organization** - Each feature/route has its own module
- **Scalability** - Easy to add sections and components to modules
- **Maintainability** - Clear structure makes code easier to navigate
- **No UI changes** - All styling and components remain exactly as before
